# Classification-using-FashionMNIST-dataset
This project implements and compares Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for image classification on the Fashion MNIST dataset using TensorFlow. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model design, training, and performance evaluation across multiple epochs. Experimental results show that the CNN consistently outperforms the DNN—achieving higher accuracy (80.2% vs. 64.9%) and lower loss (0.556 vs. 1.087)—demonstrating its superior ability to capture spatial patterns in image data. The findings highlight that while DNNs can handle abstract or tabular data effectively, CNNs are significantly better suited for visual tasks, offering faster convergence and improved generalization. Dataset is taken from tensorflow.
